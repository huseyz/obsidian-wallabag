# Obsidian Wallabag Plugin

This plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) allows you to sync [Wallabag](https://www.wallabag.it/en) items into Obsidian notes in various ways.

## Authentication

After installing and enabling the plugin first you need to authenticate yourself with your Wallabag instance.
You can follow the Wallabag's [iOS Setup guide](https://doc.wallabag.org/en/apps/ios.html) for obtaining the client attributes.

## Usage

This plugin fulfills a qiute straightforward purpose; it syncs Wallabag articles and creates notes from them in various possible formats.

Use the command "Sync Wallabag Articles" to sync new articles. Plugin will keep a track of items synced so if you delete a created note, it won't be generated again unless you use the command "Clear synced articles cache" to reset the plugin cache.

There are various settings under the plugin settings you can use to personalize your workflow, here are some important ones:

| Setting                                                | Decsription                                                                                                         |

## Templating

By default this plugin offers two builtin templates; one for inserting the content of the article as a note and one for creating a note with a link to the exported PDF, when the option is enabled. Both the templates include link to the original articles, a link to the Wallabag item and tags. See the example below:

You can use a custom template, in that case plugin will pass the following variables.
| Variable | Description |
|:----------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `id` | Wallabag ID of the article (Useful for scripting) |
| `article_title` | Title of the article |
| `original_link` | Link to the source article |
| `created_at` | Creation date of the article in Wallabag |
| `published_at` | When the article was originally published according to Wallabag |
| `updated_at` | Last modification date of the article in Wallabag <sub><br>Wallabag API seems not to change this field when modifying annotations.</sub> |
| `wallabag_link` | Link to the article in Wallabag |
| `content` | HTML content extracted by wallabag |
| `pdf_link` | An Obsidian wikilink to the exported pdf file. <sub><br> Only populated if the PDF export option is choosen.</sub> |
| `tags` | Tags attached to the Wallabag article, format depends on the setting |
| `reading_time` | Reading time of the article |
| `preview_picture` | link to preview picture of the article |
| `domain_name` | Link to the source domain article |

I mainly use the template to export pdfs and use [Annotator]() to read using the following template.

```
---
annotation-target: {{pdf_link}}
---
```
